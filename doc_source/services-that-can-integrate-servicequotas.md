# Service Quotas and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-servicequotas"></a>

Service Quotas is an AWS service that enables you to view and manage your quotas from a central location\. Quotas, also referred to as limits, are the maximum value for your resources, actions, and items in your AWS account\.

When Service Quotas is associated with AWS Organizations, you can create a quota request template to automatically request quota increases when accounts are created\.

For more information about Service Quotas, see the [Service Quotas User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/)\.

Use the following information to help you to help you integrate Service Quotas with AWS Organizations\.

## Service\-linked roles created when you enable integration<a name="integrate-enable-slr-servicequotas"></a>

The following [service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) are automatically created in your organization's accounts when you enable trusted access\. These roles allow Service Quotas to perform supported operations within the accounts in your organization\.

You can delete or modify these roles only if you disable trusted access between Service Quotas and Organizations or if the account is removed from the organization\.
