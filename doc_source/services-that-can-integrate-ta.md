# AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Organizations<a name="services-that-can-integrate-ta"></a>

AWS Trusted Advisor inspects your AWS environment and makes recommendations when opportunities exist to save money, to improve system availability and performance, or to help close security gaps\. When integrated with Organizations, you can receive Trusted Advisor check results for all of the accounts in your organization and download reports to view the summaries of your checks and any affected resources\.

For more information, see [Organizational view for AWS Trusted Advisor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/user/organizational-view.html) in the *AWS Support User Guide*\.

Use the following information to help you to help you integrate AWS Trusted Advisor with AWS Organizations\.

The following [service\-linked roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html) are automatically created in your organization's accounts when you enable trusted access\.

You can delete or modify these roles only if you disable trusted access between Trusted Advisor and Organizations or if the account is removed from the organization\.
